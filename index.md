### Project Description
Developed a Sentiment Analysis web portal and hosted the same on Heroku platform, where we can provide tweets and it tells us the sentimment (whether Positive/Negative).
I have used NLP, TFIDF vectorizer and WordNet Lemmatizer by passing POS tags on each word, the model has been trained on number of models like Naive Bayes, SVM and used Logistic Regression algorithms but found Logistic Regression to outperform others, hence selected the same as the final model.
The model has been trained on 1.6 million tweets, the dataset was available on Kaggle.
