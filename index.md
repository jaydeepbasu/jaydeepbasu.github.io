## Sentiment Analysis on Tweets
<img src="images/sentiment_analysis_tweet.png?raw=true"/>

### Project Description
Developed a Sentiment Analysis web application and hosted the same on Heroku platform, where we can provide tweets and it tells us the sentimment (whether Positive/Negative).
I have used TFIDF vectorizer and WordNet Lemmatizer by passing POS tags on each word, the model has been trained on number of models like Naive Bayes, SVM and used Logistic Regression algorithms but found Logistic Regression to outperform others, hence selected the same as the final model.
The model has been trained on 1.6 million tweets, the dataset was available on Kaggle.

## Diabetes Prediction App

### Project Description
A Web application to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.
Performed cross validation across multiple models and then selected the model with highest accuracy, found that Random Forest Classifier is giving us the highest accuracy, performed hyperparameter tuning on the same further to obtain better result.
The dataset was available on Kaggle.
Also, went ahead and created a docker file which can be used to create a docker image and the same can be used to deploy and host it on any cloud platform whatsoever.

## Fake News Detection

### Project Description
Developed a model to detect fake news, using NLTK libraries and Decision Tree classifier. I have used the dataset available in Kaggle to train the model.
Also tried out other classification models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest followed up with hyperparameter tuning of each to find out the best performing model.
